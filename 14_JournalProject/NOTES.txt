In this File we are going to save the EXTERNAL-API-LINK in database (Frequent used API) 
Disadvantage : Will it not increase the Latency (Extra an un-necessary calls in db for getting the api link) 
	       Why to do this when we can hardcode it. 
REASON : We are going to cover a topic called Application Cache. 

APPLICATION CACHE :
We store frequently used or frequently changing configurations in database
And then we load that database in our Spring Boot Application ! 





@PostConstructor : 
Will run automatically as soon as the Bean is created ! 
FOR EXAMPLE : 
@Component (Bean) 
public class XYZ { 
	
	@PostConstructor (Works like a constructor) 
	public void function() {
		// code 
	}
}
